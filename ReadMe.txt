Welcome to Hangman by Alex.Zb!

I made this just for fun


______How to Install and Run the Mini-Game_____


1. Open Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can use an IDE like Visual Studio(/Code), PyCharm, or even the default Python IDLE.

2. Download the Project: Move the entire Hangman project folder to a convenient location, like your desktop.

3. Launch the Game: Open the project folder, find the Hangman Python file (usually a .py file), and open it in your preferred IDE. Then, look for the "Run" button (it often looks like a "â–º" symbol) and press it to start the game.

4. Enjoy the Game! Have fun playing Hangman and trying to guess the words!
